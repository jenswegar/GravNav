# GravNav

Play a game of random city walk next time out on town by letting GravNav decide your next move. This makes exploring cities more fun as it might end up taking you to places you normally wouldn't go to.

###Rules
When you get to an intersection or street corner, simply tap in the number of streets you can turn into (not counting the street you came from) and shake the phone. GravNav will spin around for a while until settling on a choice. Walk down the given street until you get to the next corner. Repeat the process. 

Of course, some basic sense should be used when playing this game. If the app wants you to walk down a street that looks very dodgy you may want to shake again ;-)
